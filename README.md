# Engine Knock Demo

This repository contains an implementaton of an interactive engine knock demo.

The demo includes an engine combustion animation with several interactive sliders, allowing the user to change the RPM of the engine, and duration of the fuel injection.

Changing these two parameters can introduce engine knocking during the combustion, which is shown in the animation.

This demo is meant to be connected to an external MCU which feeds ADC data to the webpage, however the majority of the web page can be used without.
